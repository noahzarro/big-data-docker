## Import the dataset

Simply run the following script from this folder:

```bash
./import.sh
```

The script assumes that `psql` connects to the right server without further arguments. You can supply connection information [using environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-envars.html) or by modifying the script.
